**Geographic Risk Sections**

#### **Specific Flood Zones and Their Implications**

McMinnville has areas designated as flood zones, particularly along the South Yamhill River and Baker Creek. During heavy rains or rapid snowmelt, these waterways often overflow, increasing the risk of flooding for nearby properties.

**Implications for Residents and Businesses:**

* Increased insurance requirements for flood zone properties.
* Higher susceptibility to basement flooding and structural water damage.
* Proactive flood prevention measures, like sump pump installation, are critical.

#### **Local Water Table Information**

The Willamette Valley, including McMinnville, has a relatively high water table. During extended periods of rain, this elevated water table can lead to seepage into basements and crawl spaces, even in properties outside designated flood zones.

#### **Known Problem Areas in the City**

* **Baker Creek Neighborhood:**

   Frequent water pooling due to its proximity to the creek and inadequate stormwater drainage.
* **Downtown McMinnville:**

   Aging infrastructure and low-lying areas make it prone to water intrusion.
* **Three Mile Lane:**

   Increased flooding risk near the McMinnville Municipal Airport during heavy rains.

#### **Historical Flooding/Water Damage Events**

McMinnville has experienced significant flooding in past decades, most notably in the late 1990s, when heavy rains caused the South Yamhill River to overflow, impacting dozens of homes and businesses. These events have highlighted the need for proactive flood mitigation and water damage restoration services.

#### **City-Specific Soil Composition Affecting Water Damage**

The soil in McMinnville is predominantly silty clay loam, which has poor drainage properties. This increases the likelihood of water pooling, soil saturation, and foundation instability during periods of heavy rainfall.

#### **Local Weather Patterns That Increase Risk**

McMinnville receives an average of 42 inches of rainfall annually, with most precipitation concentrated between November and March. The combination of persistent rain and occasional snowmelt creates heightened risks for water damage during these months.
